        <h1 class="secondText">Everyone in China has died. You have failed China. In real life 9.5-13m people died from The Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879. It was a terrible disaster. The drought caused most of the crops in northern China to fail. China was already weak because of rebellions, and lack of strong leadership. On top of that, China was at war with Japan, so it had to divide its resources between military spending, and feeding its people. Chinese officials were also divided on how to spend their effort. One group wanted to set up a coastal defense. Another group wanted to setup a frontier defense in the northwest. A third group of lower ranking officials thought that nourishing the people should be their number one priority. These disagreements between powerful groups of officials hampered the Qing state’s ability to respond to the famine quickly and effectively. The weak Qing Court wavered between nourishing the people, or defending Qing territory from foreign invasion. The rulers were also worried about losing the Mandate of Heaven. By the late 1870s, the key issue of the rulers stopped being losing the Mandate of Heaven, and they started emphasizing defending the country from increasingly powerful foreign powers. By 1879, the famine had ended.</h1>
